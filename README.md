The following repository contains the solution to the third assignment for the Research Track 2 Course, found in the Robotics Masters Programme at the University of Genoa, Italy. 
Students were required to compare the performance of the python scripts they had created using the Python Robotics Simulator with those of their peers on a certain parameter, and write a 
report summarising the process and results.
